= Description

- **Overview**: 
    LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a protocol used for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services. Web applications commonly use LDAP to manage users and permissions.

- **Common Use Cases**:
    These APIs are commonly used to search, query, and list entries in an LDAP directory.

- **Security Risks**:
    Unauthorized Access: When applications construct LDAP queries using user input, and if proper input validation is not performed, attackers can modify the LDAP query through crafted input, leading to unauthorized access or data manipulation.
