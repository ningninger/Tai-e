= Description

- **Overview**: 
    Apache Commons BeanUtils provides a set of utility methods for manipulating Java Beans. The APIs in this directory can be used for common tasks such as property copying, property setting, and object population.

- **Common Use Cases**:
    These APIs are commonly used for copying, populating, and setting properties of Java Bean objects.

- **Security Risks**:
    Property Injection: If an attacker gains control over the objects being populated or the property names being set, they can inject unexpected and malicious property values, leading to property injection vulnerabilities.
