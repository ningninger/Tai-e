= Description

- **Overview**: 
    These APIs are methods from the Spring Framework used to parse expression strings and generate corresponding expression objects. SPEL (Spring Expression Language) is a more powerful expression language than JSP's EL, offering capabilities such as method calls and basic string templating.

- **Common Use Cases**:
    These APIs are commonly used to parse expression strings and generate corresponding expression objects, which may later be evaluated within a specific context.

- **Security Risks**:
    RCE (Remote Code Execution): If attackers can manipulate the input SpEL expressions without restrictions, evaluating the expression in the default context may lead to remote code execution vulnerabilities.
