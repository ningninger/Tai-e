= Description

- **Overview**: 
    The APIs in this directory involve file operations from the Java standard library, including file creation, reading, writing, and path handling. These classes and methods allow developers to perform various file operations, such as creating temporary files, reading file content, and writing data to files. If the parameters are unconstrained and controlled externally, attackers can exploit path traversal vulnerabilities to read and write arbitrary files.

- **Common Use Cases**:
    These APIs are commonly used for creating files and directories, reading files, writing files, and handling file paths.

- **Security Risks**:
    Path Traversal: Attackers can exploit malicious input to perform arbitrary file operations or access unsafe locations, potentially leading to unauthorized file read and write access.
