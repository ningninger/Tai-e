= Description

The Sources recorded in this directory primarily come from the Apache Wicket framework, a Java web application development framework. The source methods that can cause taint include:
- Methods that retrieve properties from the incoming request (e.g., getHeader, getParameterValue)
- Methods that obtain input streams for uploaded files (e.g., getInputStream)

These inputs are provided externally and can be spoofed.
