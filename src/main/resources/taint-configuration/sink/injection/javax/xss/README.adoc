= Description

- **Overview**: 
    Java EE provides a set of formatting and output APIs that are used to format data into specific string forms and output these strings to various targets.

- **Common Use Cases**:
    These APIs are commonly used for formatting strings, writing text to output streams, and other similar tasks.

- **Security Risks**:
    XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Attacks: If the formatted string or parameters include user input data and are not properly encoded, it may lead to XSS vulnerabilities. For example, if user input contains a `<script>` tag, it may be rendered and executed.
